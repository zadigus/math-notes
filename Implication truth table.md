The truth table of $P\Rightarrow Q$ should be satisfy the following conditions:
- it must be different from the [[Equivalence truth table]]
- the truth table of $P\iff Q$ must be the same as that of $P\Rightarrow Q \land Q\Rightarrow P$

| $P$ | $Q$ | $P\Rightarrow Q$ |
| --- | --- | ---------------- |
| V   | V   | V                |
| V   | F   | F                |
| F   | V   | V                |
| F   | F   | V                |
